This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you clicked &ldquo;accept&rdquo; or &ldquo;agree&rdquo; in connection with registering your account, we made available to you this Privacy Policy and the information handling practices described in here. This Privacy Policy only covers Google&#39;s practices regarding personal information, and not information more generally. We may use aggregated, anonymized data that we derived from your personal information before you deleted it, but not in a manner that incorporates any of your personal information or would identify you personally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn&rsquo;t covered in this Privacy Policy. You may, of course, decline to share certain personal information with Google, in which case Google may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Information Google Collects</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We collect information to provide better Services to all our users. When you&rsquo;re signed in, we collect information that we store with your Google account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Things You Create or Provide to Us</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you create a Google account, submit or access Content (as defined in the Terms of Service) or otherwise use the Services, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You may also provide your mailing address and home/mobile phone number, or other personal information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your provision of this personal data is required for you to enter into the Terms of Use, a contract, with us. If you do not provide the minimum amount of personal data required to register an account, including your name and email address, you cannot use the Services, as this information is necessary for contractual reasons. Please see &ldquo;European Requirements&rdquo; below for further information on the bases for our processing your personal information. We also collect the Content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our Services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Why Google Collects Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Google uses the information we collect for the following purposes:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Provide Our Services</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We use your information to deliver our Services, like providing you access to the Fusion Tables Archive Tool and to create archives of your tables and support map visualizations of such archives. For example is that we use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Maintain &amp; Improve Our Services</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We also use your information to ensure our Services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And we use your information to make improvements to our Services &ndash; for example, to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Google account members and to improve the way the Services work and look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our Services, which can help us build better products and address bugs or other issues that arise..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Measure Performance</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our Services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design, monitor and analyze the operation and effectiveness of the Services and related activities, and monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by Google. You can opt-out from Google Analytics by clicking here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Communicate with You</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We use the information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity on your account, or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our Services. We will also use your email address to contact you to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues; or regarding Content. And if you contact Google, we&rsquo;ll keep a record of your request to help solve any issues you might be facing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Protect Google, Our Users, and the Public</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our Services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public. For example, we collect and analyze IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse can take many forms, such as sending spam to Google users or launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Managing and Deleting Your Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Managing, Reviewing, and Updating Your Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you&rsquo;re signed into your Google account, you can always review and update information by visiting your account profile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Exporting, Removing &amp; Deleting Your Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can export a copy of content in your Google account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google by contacting us here. You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account settings page or editing your Google account profile through the Services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can also delete your Content, visualizations, and maps by using the available tools in our Services. If desired, you can delete your entire Google account by choosing that option in your account settings page.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Data Retention</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Information Retained Until You Remove It</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As we have described above, you can delete your entire Google account or selectively delete your discussion posts, uploaded datasets, and kernels by using the available tools in our Services. In some cases, rather than provide a way to delete data, we store it for a predetermined period of time. For each type of data, we set retention timeframes based on the reason for its collection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Information Retained For Extended Time Periods for Limited Purposes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sometimes business and legal requirements require us to retain certain information for specific purposes for an extended period of time. For example, when you submit an entry in a competition, we may retain this information for a longer period of time to guard against cheating, for example, or for legal purposes. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Security, fraud &amp; abuse prevention</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Financial record-keeping</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Complying with legal or regulatory requirements</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ensuring the continuity of our services</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enabling Safe and Complete Deletion</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you delete data in your Google account, we immediately start the process of removing it from the product and our systems. First, we aim to immediately remove it from view. For example, if you delete a post you made, we will immediately remove that from the public-facing Services website.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems. Safe deletion is important to protect our users and customers from accidental data loss. Complete deletion of data from our servers is equally important for users&rsquo; peace of mind. This process generally takes around 2 months from the time of deletion. This often includes up to a month-long recovery period in case the data was removed unintentionally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each of our storage systems from which data gets deleted has its own detailed process for safe and complete deletion. This might involve repeated passes through the system to confirm all data has been deleted, or brief delays to allow for recovery from mistakes. As a result, deletion could sometimes take longer when extra time is needed to safely and completely delete the data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our services also use encrypted backup storage as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters. Data can remain on these systems for up to 6 months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and timeframes defined in this article. We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">When Google Shares Your Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We are not in the business of selling your information. We do, however, disclose your personal information in connection with developing and maintaining the Services. We share your personal information in the following cases:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With your consent</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For external processing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties may have access to or process your personal information as a result of performing the services they were engaged to perform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For legal reasons</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enforce our Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations, and take precautions against liability.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google or our affiliates, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Protect the security or integrity of the Services and to protect or enforce third party rights.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners &mdash; like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our Services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we&rsquo;ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Our Commitment to Children&rsquo;s Privacy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, Google does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years old, and no part of the Services is directed to persons under 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Google learns that personal information of children under 13 years old has been collected on the Services without verifiable parental consent, then Google will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a user account on the Services, then you may alert Google at Google Support and request that Google delete that child&rsquo;s personal information from its systems. If you are between the ages of 13 and 16 years old, you may not use the Services until Google has received verifiable parental consent for your use of the Services. More information on the parental consent process can be found at Google Support.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Data Transfers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We transfer your personal data from the European Union to the United States in accordance with standard contractual clauses we entered into. The standard contractual clauses can be read here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">European Requirements</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If European Union (EU) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service. Please visit Google Support to exercise these rights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you have any questions, you may contact our data protection office at data-protection-office@Google.com. If you have concerns regarding your rights under local law, you can contact your local data protection authority. Google has appointed Google Ireland Ltd. to act as its local representative under Article 27 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Google Ireland Ltd.&rsquo;s address is Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With your consent</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can manage these settings in your Google account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When we&rsquo;re pursuing legitimate interests</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We process your information for our legitimate interests while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Providing, maintaining, and improving our Services to meet the needs of our users</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Understanding how people use our Services to ensure and improve the performance of our Services</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Providing advertising to make many of our Services freely available for users</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our Services</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Protecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Performing research that improves our Services for our users and benefits the public</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of our Terms of Use</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. Note that our amended Privacy Policy will become effective on a going-forward basis as stated in the Terms, except that (i) unless you agree otherwise, we will use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you must terminate your Google membership and cease use of the Services. Your continued use of the Services after a revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Google Contact Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Please contact Google with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, our use and disclosure practices, or your consent choices through Google Support.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Specific Contact Emails:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">General Privacy: privacy@google.com</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Data Protection Office: data-protection-office@google.com</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Security: security@google.com</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Abuse: abuse@google.com</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
